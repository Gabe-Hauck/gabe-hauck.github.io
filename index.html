  <div class="Fav-1-P1">
    <p><span class="Fav-1-P">The reason that I like martial arts is it requires you to think but also react within a short timeframe making your critical thinking better and better. The reason I like HEMA is because its a recreation of medieval european combat into a modern time. The reason I like tumbling is its just fun to do flips and other cool things like that.</span></p>
